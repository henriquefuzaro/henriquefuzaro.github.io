The presented work is a prototype of the first project of the group. The concept is to build an interactive imersive environment where a performer can navigate through a sphere full of silent movie clips and interact with them. The navigation is controlled by the users hands and position in the room, while other body features control video and audio effects.\nThe audio is also composed in real time using granular synthesis and mixing musical themes associated with each clip. This combination creates a noisy and thematic atmosphere that resembles an antique silent movie cinema. A shared space is created using the network, so that many actors can perform in real time, each one from its own machine. This process is documented at this publication.\n","date":1551225600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551225600,"objectID":"6ffa73be88dbc57e44f8bf5de46f2cfb","permalink":"https://andresbrocco.github.io/project/audiovisual-in-shared-space-as-a-metaphor-for-mindscapes/","publishdate":"2019-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/audiovisual-in-shared-space-as-a-metaphor-for-mindscapes/","section":"project","summary":"Prototype of Interactive art installation (P.A.I. group at the NICS laboratory).","tags":["Human-Computer Interface","Multimodal Interaction","Kinect","Java","Processing","Audio-Visual","Feature Extraction","Art Installation","Real time","Generative Art","Networked Performance","Collaborative Creation"],"title":"Audio-visuals in shared space as a metaphor for mindscapes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Group \u0026lsquo;Perception, Action, and Interaction\u0026rsquo; at NICS explores the interaction between humans and digital media; \u0026lsquo;Perception\u0026rsquo; stands for audio analysis, psychoacoustics and visual cognition; \u0026lsquo;Action\u0026rsquo; stands for designing sound and visual arts; \u0026lsquo;Interaction\u0026rsquo; stands for how humans interfaces with the digital environment. One ongoing research example is the sonification of human body movement with application purposes in music therapy.\nOne of the devices used by the laboratory to sense the body movements is the Microsoft Kinect. Therefore, some projects rely on a robust tool to preprocess the incoming data and extract body movement features. My role is to develop that tool and make it available as an user friendly software for people with low level of knowledge in software development.\nThe main features implemented in the library available on my github are:\n Interface with KinectV2 Smooth skeleton Calibrate for the floor position and room size Extract body features Send features through network via OSC  The video below is a brief demonstration of the library and its features.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

The main goal is to assist the music learning process, by attaching vision and audition.\nThe ChromaJammer was written in the PureData programming language. The patch gets the audio from an external source (mic or music player) and analyses which notes are being played. Each note has an associated color. The color scheme was based on the circle of fifths, since it arranges the notes in an interesting manner: the interval between adjacent notes is the most consonant possible. The circle of fifths is drawn alongside a representation of a guitar arm. When a note is identified, its respective frets lights up on the guitar arm.\nAs an amateur musician, I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to improvise on the guitar, but struggled in learning music theory. On the other hand, I found myself with the right knowledge to develop a tool to enhance my capabilities. The project is open-source and can be downloaded from my GitHub repository. I hope more people enjoy the tool, and maybe some day I\u0026rsquo;ll go back to this project.\nI have made a video presenting the patch and showing it in action!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

The algorithm developed by us analyses the music in real time to create synesthetic visual effects.\nThe installation was presented in a music festival: the audio from the DJ mixer was captured by an audio interface, and processed in a Pure Data patch. This patch simulated a fluid that was reacting to several audio features in real time.\nThe fluid positions were then mapped to a color palette, forming visual streams in a wave-like motion. Each particle of the fluid was then mapped to a corresponding Led in a strip. This information was sent through the network to a Raspberry Pi, which controlled 12 Led Strips.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

After some experiments, I have found that the interaction with the fluid is negligible, and the only relevant characteristics were the geometry and material of the instrument.\nTherefore, the frequencies of the instruments notes can be determined by a simple modal analysis.
