      <description>&lt;p&gt;Medooze is a personal project developed by me and Gabriela Bittencourt, consisting of a smart lighting system. The algorithm developed by us analyses the music in real time to create synesthetic visual effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation was presented in a music festival: the audio from the DJ mixer was captured by an audio interface, and processed in a Pure Data patch. This patch simulated a fluid that was reacting to several audio features in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fluid positions were then mapped to a color palette, forming visual streams in a wave-like motion. Each particle of the fluid was then mapped to a corresponding Led in a strip. This information was sent through the network to a Raspberry Pi, which controlled 12 Led Strips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total of 60m of Led Strips were placed above the dance floor, streaming out from the DJ cabine. You can see the infrastructure in the pictures below.&lt;/p&gt;
