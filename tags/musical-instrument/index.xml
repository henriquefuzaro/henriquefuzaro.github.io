      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Steel Tongue Drum is a recently invented musical instrument that consists of a curved and cutted steel plate, shown at the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;Steel_Tongue_Drum.png&#34; alt=&#34;Steel Tongue Drum&#34; style=&#34;width:40%&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The instrument is mainly handcrafted, so by the time of this research there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any study on its acoustic properties. For this reason, the idea of my bachelor thesis was to propose a scientific approach on designing this instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was to understand which mechanical characteristics determines the acoustic response. After some experiments, I have found that the interaction with the fluid is negligible, and the only relevant characteristics were the geometry and material of the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the frequencies of the instruments notes can be determined by a simple modal analysis. The cover image of this page shows the displacement of one of the instruments vibration modes. You can take a look at the full report (in portuguese) at the &amp;ldquo;PDF&amp;rdquo; link.&lt;/p&gt;
